# FlickEdit

Level Editor for Flicky on the Sega Genesis.


At this time the editor only takes in raw binary level files and outputs raw binary level files.


Refer to https://github.com/Luu-uuu/Flicky-Disassembly/tree/master/Misc/Level%20Layouts


Eventually this project will become full featured level editor.

- Implement editing of the rest level objects
- Implement accepting .SMD roms and full Flicky binaries
